Silently he stole upon him
Till the red nails of the monster
Almost touched him almost scared him
Till the hot breath of his nostrils
Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis
As he drew the Belt of Wampum
Over the round ears that heard not
Over the small eyes that saw not
Over the long nose and nostrils
The black muffle of the nostrils
Out of which the heavy breathing
Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis
